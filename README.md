# go15env
Painless bootstrapping of golang. It downloads ands installs GO,
sets GOROOT, GOPATH and GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT and runs default shell.

## Running
Download latest version from releases and run it in shell. After the GO is
bootstrapped you will end up in shell with "Vendoring" enabled and with fresh
env setup for you.

## Why
Because I hate doing it the official way. And this way it's can be used directly
 with something like Atom editor.
